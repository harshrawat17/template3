# Description

Designed a 10 mA Wide Swing NMOS Cascode Current mirror with a 1mA reference current. 
Device dimensions were chosen appropriately to obtain a minimum operating output voltage of 
0.4 V.

# Description

Designed a Telescopic Cascode amplifier (NMOS input pair) for a DC gain of 40 dB and a UGB 
of 100 MHz for 10 pF load capacitance and the bias current limited to 10 mA and input common 
level in the range 0.6 V to 1.2 V

# Two stage Miller Compensated amplifier

# Description

Designed a Two stage Miller Compensated amplifier for a DC gain of 40 dB and bias currents of 
1mA and 10 mA for first and second stage respectively and input common mode range of 0.6 V 
to 1.2 V. The compensation capacitor was chosen to obtain a Phase Margin (PM) of 60‚Å∞.
